# MonographProduct

## Development of a Natural Language Processing Model that Summarizes Text to Explain its Creation Process for Beginners.

## Recommendations
The Python files are in version 3.7 and are in `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) format. It is recommended to open them in Jupyter Lab, as they do not work in Google Colab.

## File List
* Requirements
* MonographInitial
* TestingMonograph
* Training_Checkpoints

### Requirements
This file contains the necessary dependencies (libraries/pips) to run the model.

### MonographInitial
This file includes the entire preprocessing and processing of the model, training included.

### TestingMonograph
This file is where you will be able to summarize texts.

### Training_Checkpoints
This file contains the weights of the model, trained until epoch 50. It is necessary to be able to run the testing monograph.
